# DuckVideoPlayer  
An app that can take any video and play it using a supported terminal using ASCII art.  
- Only works on Linux systems currently.
- FreeType library should be installed.  
- Use build.sh to build the main.c  
- Current version relies on pre-extracted frames in a folder (presumably using FFmpeg).  
- The video you want to play should in be the following dimensions.  
- If your terminal has x columns and y rows:  
  x < Video Width  
  y < Video Height/2 + 2  

- Still under progress...
