# DuckVideoPlayer  
An app that can take any video and play it using a supported terminal using ASCII art.  
- Current version relies on pre-extracted frames in a folder (presumably using FFmpeg).  
- The video you want to play should in be the following dimensions.  
- If your terminal has x columns and y rows:  
  x <= Video Width  
  y <= Video Height/2 + 2  

- Still under progress...
